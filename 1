    "The algorithm would undoubtedly be more accurate if all (or many) socio-economic groups were better represented; however, for the purpose of this experiment, I have decided to choose Indigenous students as representative of those facing the greatest racial discrimination and likewise trans/queer students as those facing greatest gender discrimination which is otherwise unaddressed. A revision would account for many more student profiles, to prevent students with different backgrounds but similar circumstances from scoring the same (as is illustrated by Cases 4 and 10). Anonymousness is important for this algorithm to be accurate, as many may be unlikely to divulge personal details that may be professionally jeopardizing due to stigmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another inaccuracy exists in understanding who is at greatest need, and what constitutes that need. In reflection with another student during the planning phase, they had made the decision not to prioritize queer students \"just because they are queer,\" insinuating to do so was in-itself a discrimination, which is valid in that I imagine some may be taken aback with such frank questioning. However, they did so without an understanding of the disproportionate frequency that LGBTQIA+ youth are underhoused, and the likelihood that if underhoused as youth, they are more likely to experience displacement as adults. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some regard this algorithm is designed to bring to the forefront connections between social demographic and this risk. Nonconcurrent to this sentiment, especially on university campuses, there are many exceptions to distinctions of class, access, and status. Two represented examples of operating outside of class or racial distinction are Case 2, an Indigenous students from an urban center that does not experience the poverty impacting many rural Indigenous populations, and Case 1, a student whose poverty is implied to be the result of his educational costs. The intention with this short list of questions was to hint at intersections and consider that it is within these exceptions and overlap that the efficiency of the algorithm becomes most apparent, as is clearly shown in the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce bias, I included also some more normative systems of determining seniority, such as number of semesters remaining in the program, to give priority to students finishing their studies and to make the algorithm \"fairer\" as to not over-privilege those facing discriminations. Overall, the algorithm is effective in its' current form which is intended to be as concise yet representative of as many student populations as possible. The algorithm functions both to ensure the fulfillment of universal needs, such as access to food and functional workspace, for all students, while presenting a clear and intentional bias toward vulnerable populations that historically do not as easily secure safe and affordable housing."
